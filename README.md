# Problem Set 1 Repository for Big Data and Machine Learning for Applied Economics

This is the repository for the problem set 1.

The repository contains four folders:

- `document`: contains the final document in `pdf` format. Ideally, the document should pull figures and tables directly from the `views` folder. I've included a latex template I created for the Thesis Seminar. 
- `scripts`: contains all the scripts
- `stores`: contains all the data sets used.
- `views`: contains all figures and tables
